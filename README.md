# IT Help Desk

Welcome to **It Help Desk**, a web application project created to keep my skills sharp while I worked in a different field. This project simulates a real-world scenario where users can report technology-related issues, interact through comments, and track the resolution process. It was an excellent way to showcase my abilities in web development, database management, and user interface design.

## Features

- **Issue Reporting:** Implement a form where users can submit detailed reports of technology issues they're facing, integrating functionalities to categorize and tag issues for efficient organization.

- **Commenting System:** Develop a system where both users and administrators can add comments to issues, facilitating a dialogue that could lead to faster and more effective resolutions.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Create an admin interface to view all reported issues, update their status (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved), and manage user interactions, providing administrative control over the ticket lifecycle.

- **User Dashboard:** Design a personalized dashboard for users where they can view and track the status of their reported issues, enhancing the user experience with a clear and concise overview of their tickets.

- **Status Updates:** Enable administrators to update the status of issues, reflecting the current state of resolution and keeping the issue reporter informed throughout the process.
